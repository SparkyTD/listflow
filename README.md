# Listflow
A simple, minimalistic and privacy-respecting shopping list / todo list app for Android. No ads, no telemetry, no paid subscriptions.

### What it does
Listflow is a straightforward list management app that focuses on being simple and effective:
- Create and manage multiple named lists
- Add, edit, check/uncheck, highlight items
- Optionally specify custom quantities for items
- Simple and intuitive interface
- Share lists with a second device, synchronize between devices (end-to-end encrypted)

### What it doesn't do
Listflow does **not** include:
- Ads
- Account creation requirements
- "Premium" features or any kind of subscription
- Analytics or any form of data collection
- Full-screen popups begging you to pay
- Any other useless bloat

## Installation
The app is currently not being distributed on the Play Store, so the easiest way to get started is to grab the latest APK from the [Releases](../../releases) page and install it on your Android device.

Note: When installing, Android might warn you about installing apps from unknown sources. This is normal for apps not distributed through the Play Store. The app is open source, and you can verify the code yourself.
